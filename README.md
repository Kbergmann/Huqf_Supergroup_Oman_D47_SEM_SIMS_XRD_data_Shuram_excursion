# shuram_excursion_carbonates_oman
Github repository for Bergmann et al., Origins and alteration of Ediacaran carbonates recording the Shuram excursion in Oman

This repository contains data, code, and supporting materials for our study of the carbonate strata associated with the Shuram excursion, the largest known negative carbon isotope excursion in Earth's history. Our research investigates sedimentological, geochemical, and isotopic evidence to evaluate the nature and degree of diagenesis in these carbonate rocks, with a focus on understanding primary signals and diagenetic overprints.

Project Overview:
The Shuram excursion is recognized globally in Ediacaran strata. 

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

This repository includes:

code/: Python scripts for data analysis and figure generation.

data/: Contains processed datasets for stratigraphic, geochemical, and isotopic analyses.

data/GPS_coord: corresponding GPS locations for all sample sites in Excel format

data/Stratigraphic_Columns:
A composite stratigraphic column. Detailed drawn stratigraphic columns in PDF format.

data/XRD:
Raw and processed diffraction data for Shuram samples, in Word and XRML.

data/ICP:
Data on trace metal analysis, following strong and acidic leachates, in Excel format.

data/SEM:
Microstructural and BSE images from various samples, including cryo-fracturing experiments, in TIFF format.

data/EBSD:
Processed EBSD data and associated raw images for calcite and dolomite samples, in PDF and JPG formats.

data/EPMA:
Quantitative point datasets of elemental analysis of calcite and dolomite samples accompanied by images with labeled point locations, in CSV and PDF formats. Also includes EPMA maps of element counts in TXT format.

data/XAS:
Analysis of Mn and Fe standards, as well as processed Shuram data from SSRL in Excel format.

data/13C_18O_isotopes:
Isotopic results in CSV format

data/D47:
Processed and raw datasets of clumped isotope measurements from Oman samples collected at MIT. Includes raw voltage data for each analysis and processed outputs from ClumpyCrunch and BLIMP, as well as plots summarizing standards and results, in CSV, HTML, and PNG formats.

data/Burial_History:
Burial history models for three wells (A, B, C), in CSV format.

data/sims:
Raw and processed isotopic measurements as well as labeled SEM images of each analyzed point, in CSV, XLS, ASC, and PDF formats.

figures/
All figures included in the study, in PDF format.

Field Photographs:
Field images from different stratigraphic intervals, classified by depositional stages (e.g., pre-, syn-, onset, recovery), in JPG format.

Key Features
Analysis of four modes of diagenetic alteration, highlighting sediment-buffered diagenesis and authigenic carbonate precipitation as important components of Shuram excursion nadir.
Integration of techniques spanning scales from microscale to outcrop.
