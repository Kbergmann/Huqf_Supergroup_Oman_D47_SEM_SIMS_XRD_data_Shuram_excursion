# shuram_excursion_carbonates_oman
Github repository for Bergmann et al., in review, Origins and alteration of Ediacaran carbonates in the Shuram excursion of Oman

This repository contains data, code, and supporting materials for our study of the carbonate strata associated with the Shuram excursion, the largest known negative carbon isotope excursion in Earth's history. Our research investigates sedimentological, geochemical, and isotopic evidence to evaluate the nature and degree of diagenesis in these carbonate rocks, with a focus on understanding primary signals and diagenetic overprints.

Project Overview
The Shuram excursion, recognized globally in Ediacaran strata, provides crucial insights into environmental and biological evolution preceding the rise of complex multicellular organisms. This repository includes:

Data and figures documenting sedimentological and geochemical characteristics.
Code for statistical analysis and figure generation.
Supporting materials for understanding diagenetic alteration processes.

Repository Contents
data/: Contains raw and processed datasets for geochemical and isotopic analyses.
code/: Python scripts for data analysis and figure generation.
figures/: High-resolution figures included in the publication.
docs/: Supporting documents, such as methodology descriptions and supplementary materials.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Key Features
Analysis of four modes of diagenetic alteration, highlighting sediment-buffered diagenesis and authigenic carbonate precipitation.
Integration of techniques spanning scales from microscale to outcrop.
Insights into terrestrial and marine environmental conditions during early animal evolution.
